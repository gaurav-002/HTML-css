how to retrieve value from input textbox in html
document represents entire document of html
document object takes entire document and using .getElementById allows us to identify
 which textbox to take value from on basis of id and .value will return the value. 
 var number = document.getElementById("textNumber").value;



.innerHTML property (not a function) is used along side with .getElementId to write into the HTML page.


only use inline if you are overriding only 1 or 2 attributes.
